### TODOs
- Transformer
    - [Transformers Physics Problems - Voltage, Current & Power Calculations - Electromagnetic Induction - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJm-FOMeG4E)
    - There should be a case where output impedance (Series + parallel) is considered, so that we can get the output current of the transformer
        - [Output impedance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_impedance)
- Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
    - [Maximum Power Transfer Theorem Using Nodal Analysis & Thevenin Equivalent Circuits - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CA6ZNXgI-Y&list=PL0o_zxa4K1BV9E-N8tSExU1djL6slnjbL&index=41)
- pull up / down
- fuse
    - > Power (Watts) / Voltage (Volts) = Current (Amps). Then, choose a fuse with a slightly higher amperage rating than the calculated current, typically around 125%
    - > The fuse's current rating must be lower than that of the cable. This is to ensure that the fuse will fail first to prevent the cable from overheating.
